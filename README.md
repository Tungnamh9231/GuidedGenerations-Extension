## ⚙️ Settings

All extension settings are managed via SillyTavern's Extension Settings panel:

- **Auto-Trigger**: toggle automatic execution of:
  - Thinking Guide
  - State Guide
  - Clothes Guide
  - Custom Auto Guide
  - Separated Thinking, which runs after a generated assistant message and creates a corrected swipe.

- **Buttons Visibility**: show or hide action buttons:
  - 1st Person Impersonation (👤)
  - 2nd Person Impersonation (👥)
  - 3rd Person Impersonation (🗣️)
  - Guided Response (🐕)
  - Guided Swipe (👈)
  - Persistent Guides Menu (📖)
  - Simple Send (✈️)
  - **Simple Send: Character (👤)** *(NEW)*
  - Recover Input (↩️)
  - Edit Intros (🖋️)
  - **Edit Description (📇)** *(NEW)*
  - Optional tool buttons such as Corrections, Spellchecker, and Separated Thinking.

- **Injection Role**: select the role (`system`, `assistant`, or `user`) used when injecting instructions.

- **Debug Mode**: when enabled, shows detailed debug information in the browser console. Useful for troubleshooting but can clutter the console during normal use.

- **Presets & Profiles**: for each guide/tool (Clothes, State, Thinking, Situational, Rules, Custom, Corrections, Separated Thinking, Spellchecker, Edit Intros, **Edit Description** *(NEW)*, Impersonation 1st/2nd/3rd), you can select a preset or profile.

  **GG Internal Helper Preset** is available (and set as the default) for the guides and tools that benefit from a helper-oriented prompt stack — Clothes, State, Thinking, Situational, Rules, Corrections, Separated Thinking, Spellchecker, Edit Intros, and **Edit Description** *(NEW)*.

- **Prompt Files and Overrides**: default prompt templates are stored in [`prompts.json`](./prompts.json), so they can be edited outside SillyTavern. By default the extension reads from `prompts.json` but can be set to load from an external URL in settings.

  Use `{{input}}` for your input text and other placeholders as supported. Prompt coverage includes:
  - Clothes Guide Prompt
  - State Guide Prompt
  - Thinking Guide Prompt
  - Situational Guide Prompt
  - Rules Guide Prompt
  - Corrections Prompt
  - Separated Thinking Prompt
  - Spellchecker Prompt
  - Impersonate 1st/2nd/3rd Person Prompts
  - Guided Continue Prompt
  - Guided Response Prompt
  - Guided Swipe Prompt
  - Custom Auto Guide Prompt
  - Edit Intros Prompts
  - **Edit Description Prompts** *(NEW)*
    - Edit Existing
    - Create New
    - Create New with Format
    - Create World

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Buttons:** Ensure SillyTavern is up to date (v1.12.9+) and LALib is installed/enabled.
- **Context Menus Not Appearing:** Try switching chats or re-adding the extension in the Quick Replies menu.
- **Edit Description Not Working:** Make sure the character has a description textarea available in the character editor.
- **Other Issues:** Restart SillyTavern, check for updates, and consult the [SillyTavern documentation](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).
